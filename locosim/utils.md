# Utilities for Linux			

Here I suggest you a collection of useful utilities to install in your machine:



```
sudo apt install terminator
```

Nice terminal manager with CTRL+E you split the screen vertically and with  CTRL+O horizzontally



```
sudo apt install meld
```

Needed to solve conflicts in git operations, when you call **git mergetool**



```
sudo apt install ipython
```

Interactive interface of Python



```
sudo apt install gedit
```

User-friendly text editor with graphical user interface 



```
sudo apt install nano
```

Not user friendly text editor without graphical user interface but it always works



```
sudo apt install cmake-curses-gui
```

Terminal base utility to manage configuration files of Cmake, you call with ccmake command, the GUI alternative  is obtained installing [cmake-qt-gui](apt://cmake-qt-gui)



```
sudo apt install git-cola
```

User friendly graphical interface to do git operations (commits, etc). A must.



```
sudo apt install gitg
```

Graphical interface equivalent to do **git log** to see the tree of commits



```
sudo apt install gitk
```

Old fashion version of gitg but it allows you to see the history of changes for a single file! gitk -- filename



```
sudo apt install synaptic
```

Package manager that allows you to see where the packages are installed, versions, etc. Very useful.



```
sudo apt install htop
```

Task manager that allows you to see the computational burden of your CPU cores, RAM allocated and process running.
