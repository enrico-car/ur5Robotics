## Vision
We developed the vision part as the combination of two main techniques: Yolo and ICP.
We use Yolo in order to understand where the blocks are on the table, and then the ICP technique to truly obtain the center of the object and its orientation. 

#### Yolo - You Only Look Once


#### ICP - Iterativa Closest Point
